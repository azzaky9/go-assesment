# Requirements for Product CRUD and User Control with RBAC and JWT

## Product CRUD
1. **Create Product**
  - **POST /api/products**
    - Create a new product.
    - Validate required fields (e.g., name, price, description).
    - Only accessible by users with appropriate roles (e.g., Admin).

2. **Read Product**
  - **GET /api/products/{id}**
    - Fetch product details by ID.
  - **GET /api/products**
    - List all products with optional filters (e.g., category, price range).
    - Accessible by all authenticated users.

3. **Update Product**
  - **PUT /api/products/{id}**
    - Update product details by ID.
    - Validate input fields.
    - Only accessible by users with appropriate roles (e.g., Admin).

4. **Delete Product**
  - **DELETE /api/products/{id}**
    - Delete a product by ID.
    - Only accessible by users with appropriate roles (e.g., Admin).

## User Control with RBAC
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - Define roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, User).
  - Assign permissions to roles for accessing specific endpoints.

2. **User Management**
  - **POST /api/users**
    - Create new users.
  - **PUT /api/users/{id}/roles**
    - Assign roles to users.
  - **GET /api/users/{id}**
    - Fetch user details and roles.
    - Only accessible by Admin.

3. **Authentication and Authorization**
  - Use JWT tokens for user authentication.
  - Secure endpoints with token validation.
  - Include role-based checks for protected routes.

4. **Token Management**
  - **POST /api/auth/refresh**
    - Refresh JWT tokens.
  - Implement token expiration and revocation mechanisms.
